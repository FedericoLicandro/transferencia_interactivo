Boundary condition type.

### fields


- `g`: boundary function (for the solution or the gradient of the solution depending on the `type(T)`, `T âˆˆ {Newmann,Dirichlet} ` of BC).

- `label`: Identifier for the boundary condition.

- `type`: Type of the Boundary condition, `Newmann()` for gradient condition, `Dirichlet()` for imposed value condition.
